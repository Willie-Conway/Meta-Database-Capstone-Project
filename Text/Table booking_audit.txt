Table: booking_audit

The booking_audit table is designed to track changes made to bookings for accountability and analysis. This table will help maintain a history of actions taken on bookings, including when they were created, updated, or canceled.

Fields:

AuditID: A unique identifier for each audit record. This should be set as the primary key.
BookingID: The unique identifier for the booking being audited, linking to the bookings table.
Action: The type of action performed on the booking (e.g., Created, Updated, Canceled).
ActionDate: The date and time when the action was performed, allowing you to track when changes occurred.
PerformedBy: The identifier of the staff member who performed the action, linking to the staff table. This could help in accountability.

OldValue: A JSON or text field storing the previous state of the booking before the change. This allows for understanding what was altered.

NewValue: A JSON or text field storing the new state of the booking after the change, providing clarity on what the current state is.


Notes

AuditID: Using an auto-incrementing integer ensures unique identifiers for each audit record.

Action: Using ENUM restricts the values to valid actions, maintaining data integrity.

ActionDate: Automatically records the time of the action, which is crucial for auditing purposes.

OldValue and NewValue: Storing the state as text allows for flexibility in tracking complex booking data.
